General Instructions for Gameplay:

There are two characters
Player one has WASD, Z, X, and C as their controls
Player two has Arrow keys, ",", ".", ad "/" as controls

WASD and Arrow keys are for movement
Z and "," are for blocking (reducing damage)
X ad "." are for normal attacks
C and "/" are for heavy attacks


Comparison with Proposal:

In the settings page, we were not able to include the customizable
framerates due to a lack of time. 

However, we were able to add in extra features such as the lightning effect
when a character gets taken out, being able to fall down to the platform
below, as well as an end screen after the game is over to show each player's
stats. 

Known Bugs:
Unfinished end (stats) screen
